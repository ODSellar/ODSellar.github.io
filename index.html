I&#x27;m a Full-Stack Developer with 3 years of industry experience and an interesting 2 year detour into the realm of IT management. I enjoy untangling the complex challenges that software development can present, and I&#x27;m motivated by creating applications that can make a tangible difference in people&#x27;s lives.</p><h2 class="mt-4 -mb-4">History</h2><div class=" my-4"><h3><a href="https://www.metricell.com/">Metricell</a></h3><p class=" mb-1"><i class=" font-extralight">Software Developer, Febuary 2022 - Present</i></p><p>Metricell is where I found my stride as a Software Developer. Working in a team of about 15 people in offices worldwide to deliver tools used by mobile networks worldwide. Initially, I worked to fix bugs, then quickly moved on to developing small features. After about a year, I started pushing forward the development of more prominent features, conducting code reviews, and helping to drive the processes and tools used by the department forward.</p><br/><p>Currently, I am focused more on larger projects to gain experience designing larger systems. One of the larger projects I&#x27;ve worked on is the Asset Locator project; this tool is intended for councils to lease out local assets to third parties, such as mobile network companies. This project aims to help facilitate the rollout of new technologies like 5G that require more densely clustered cell towers than previous generations of network technology.</p><br/><p>At Metricell, I learnt much more about the full development process, from requirements gathering to CI/CD and how to effectively work with a team of developers. In my spare time, I started expanding my software development and engineering knowledge by reading books, following software blogs, and working on personal projects.</p></div><div class=" my-4"><h3><a href="/cottno">Cottno - Personal Project</a></h3><p class=" mb-1"><i class=" font-extralight"> Febuary 2023 - June 2023</i></p><p>The idea behind Cottno was to create a mapping website where communities, such as climbers, divers, birdwatchers, etc., could search for and add points of interest for their community (outdoor climbs, dive locations, bird-watching hides, etc.). Climbing is one of my hobbies, and the main motivations behind this project were to develop my understanding of mapping software and techniques, explore new technology, and create an actual functional website from start to finish.</p><br/><p>After months of work, I developed a prototype website I was happy with. I used Next.js for the front end and authentication, then C# ASP .NET Core 7 for the rest of the backend and a Postgres database. I choose to host the Website on AWS. The key features of the prototype were, A working map navigable by touch and mouse, debounced url updating to track the map&#x27;s last location similar to google maps, user authentication, creating maps similar to how Reddit boards are created, and the ability to add and view points on a map with details about the point.</p><br/><p>The project was a success. I learnt a lot about the technologies used, project planning, the whole development process, and the importance of testing and documentation. One of the main challenges was creating the map. I decided to use Pixi.js, a 2D graphics library, rather than a mapping library, as one of my aims was to learn more about mapping techniques. This took a fair amount of time and refactoring to get to a stable working map. I am happy with the result, though if I continue with the project, I would like to refactor it further; as I continued to learn about mapping techniques, I realised that some of my early decisions, such as using latitude and longitude heavily, might not be ideal.</p><br/><p>I hosted the website on AWS but quickly realised it would cost well over Â£1000 a year to run even on minimum specs. Unfortunately, as the main website is a map, I believe it will always be relatively resource intensive compared to a simple website, and even if I managed to monetise it, I&#x27;m not confident that it would be able to sustain itself. Sadly, the project is mothballed for now, but I will take the lessons learned and experience onto the next project!</p><br/><p>You can check out the map <a href="/cottno">here</a> and the code for it in this website&#x27;s <a href="https://github.com/ODSellar/ODSellar.github.io">repo</a> in the cotto directory.</p></div><div class=" my-4"><h3><a href="https://www.thefrygroup.co.uk/">The Fry Group</a></h3><p class=" mb-1"><i class=" font-extralight">Software Developer / IT Manager, November 2017 - January 2022</i></p><p>After university, I found my first graduate job at The Fry Group. I started there as a Junior Programmer and Help Desk Analyst as part of the IT department made up of myself and two others. I was tasked with migrating legacy internal tools written in Visual FoxPro into a more modern programming language. Left mainly to my own devices, I worked independently to convert the internal tools to C# WPF .NET with check-ins with the IT manager to ensure I was making progress.</p><br/><p>During my first couple of years at The Fry Group, I converted multiple small internal tools over to C# WPF and was working on a larger project to convert the company CRM (Client Relationship Management) system to WPF .NET. At this point, tragically, my friend and colleague, the IT Manager, fell ill and was unable to work. Over time I picked up the responsibilities of IT Manager as these were often a higher priority than my own work, and after about 6 months was given the title of IT Manager.</p><br/><p>I worked as the IT Manager for The Fry Group for two years, long enough to see through the project converting the CRM system over to WPF .NET to its end, through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to gain valuable skills in time management, organisation, planning, project management, and decision-making. But I craved to get back to creating things and the challenges of software development, which led to my next role at Metricell.</p></div><div class=" my-4"><h3><a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/">University of Bath</a></h3><p class=" mb-1"><i class=" font-extralight">BSc Hons Computer Science, Summer 2017</i></p><p>At the University of Bath, I learnt the fundamentals of Software development. I took modules in maths, computer vision, software engineering, and user experience, to name a few.
